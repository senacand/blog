Hey there, I'm Sena, an Indonesian ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© software engineer currently living in Tokyo ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µğŸ—¼!

I'm mainly an iOS Software Engineer, though I do explore other software engineering stacks outside work. I have basic understanding of Flutter, web development, and a little of backend development.

This blog is a place where I will post random tech-related thoughts that show up in my mind.
